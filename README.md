# FLAME GPU 2 Fire Tutorial (Python 3)

This repository provides a Tutorial on using the Python 3 interface for [FLAME GPU 2](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2).

## Tutorial

The tutorial is a Jupyter notebook which uses a Fire spread model to demonstrate how models can be described and implemented using FLAME GPU 2's python interface, and then simulated to visualise the emergent behaviour of the model.

A number of exercises are presented to change and extend the behaviour of the model and observe the differences.
Solutions are provided.

## Instructor-led Tutorials

Instructor-led delivery of this tutorial will typically use hosted Jupyter solutions, such as cloud instances on [InstanceHub](https://www.instancehub.com/) or through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Please refer to the instructions provided during by the instructor(s) on how to access the tutorial in this case.

If you are interested in an instructor-led delivery of this tutorial, please [contact us](https://flamegpu.com/contact/).

## Self-paced Tutorials

If you wish to follow this tutorial at your own pace, you can run this tutorial locally.

### Google Colab

You can launch the notebook in Colab using the link below. Some additional steps are required within the notebook which are described.

 - [Launch Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2_python_sugarscape_tutorial/blob/main/FLAMEGPU-Tutorial.ipynb)

### Running this Tutorial Locally

> **Note**: The notebook currently assumes you are using python 3.6, with CUDA 11.0 on a Linux x86_64 machine. This will be corrected in the future.

To run this tutorial locally you will require:

+ Python `>= 3.10`
+ CUDA `>= 12.0` and a [Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) >= 5.0 NVIDIA GPU
+ Linux with `glibc >= 2.28`
  + Windows support/instructions will be introduced at a later date
+ An `x86_64` CPU
  + Including [`NVRTC`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvrtc/index.html)
  + If you wish to run this tutorial on an `ppc64le` or `arm64-sbsa` based-system, you will need to build `pyflamegpu` from source.
  Please see the main [FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2) repository for instructions on building from source.
+ NodeJS installed to support interactive plotting

1. Clone the repository if you have not already done so

2. Create a new python `venv` or conda environment and activate it
  
    ```bash
    # I.e. if using a venv on linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. [Install Jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) (or jupyter notebook)

    ```bash
    # I.e. if using a venv and pip
    python3 -m pip install -U jupyterlab matplotlib ipympl notebook
    ```

4. Launch `jupyter lab` or the legacy `jupyter notebook` interface and open `FLAME_GPU_2_python_tutorial.ipynb`

    ```bash
    # Using jupyter lab
    jupyter lab FLAMEGPU-tutorial.ipynb
    # Using jupyter notebook
    jupyter notebook FLAMEGPU-tutorial.ipynb
    ```

## Known Issues

### Ipympl backend

Colab also has a known [bug](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/5425) with `ipympl` which is used for interactive plotting of the results. Support for `ipympl` is planned in a future release. For now a work-around is included which requires restarting the kernel.
